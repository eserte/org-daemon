The App-orgdaemon distribution provides the "org-daemon" program, a
Perl/Tk application which sits in the background and "warns" about
appointments found in configured Emacs org-mode files.

Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Installation without downloading the distribution:

	cpan App::orgdaemon

or

	cpanm App::orgdaemon

You can use the org-daemon script found in the bin subdirectory also
directly, without installation. Make sure that at least Perl/Tk is
installed. On a Debian based system this dependency could be installed
using

	sudo apt-get install perl-tk

Usage:

	org-daemon --recheck-interval=3 /path/to/TODO.org &

Run "perldoc bin/org-daemon" or "tkpod bin/org-daemon" for complete
documentation.
